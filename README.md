Hello and welcome to my Github profile! My name is Sukhmanpreet Kaur, and I am a data enthusiast with a passion for using technology to solve complex problems and make a positive impact on society. Currently pursuing an MSc in Physics from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, I possess a deep understanding of various machine learning algorithms and techniques, as well as their practical applications.

With a strong interest in artificial intelligence, I am committed to using my skills to develop innovative solutions that address real-world challenges. I have experience working as a Data Science Intern at Suvidha Foundation, where I implemented an NLP model for abstractive text summarization using a modified version of Seq2Seq model with a generator and a discriminator. Additionally, I have worked as a Web Designer Intern at Coursenator, where I designed and executed the frontend of the website utilizing FIGMA, a robust browser-based UX/UI design tool.

## [Project 4: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Prediction](https://github.com/vashisht099/Polycystic-Ovary-Syndrome-Prediction.git)
- Implemented a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women based on a 
variety of physiological and demographic factors.
- Analyzed a large dataset of patient records, identifying key features and patterns that were predictive of PCOS, while taking measures to ensure 
data privacy and security.
- Optimized Logistic, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifiers using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
- Evaluated the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving an 
impressive accuracy rate of 88% on the test dataset.
- Created a user-friendly web application that allows clinicians and patients to input relevant data and obtain a personalized prediction of their risk 
for PCOS, using Flask web framework and HTML/CSS for the front-end design.


## [Project 5: Real Estate Price Prediction](https://github.com/vashisht099/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Interface_hPP%201.png)
- Developed and implemented a machine learning model to predict the prices of apartments in Bengaluru.
- Utilized cross validation techniques to assess model performance and identify potential overfitting. Also, conducted hyperparameter tuning to 
optimize the model accuracy.
- Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
- Created a user-friendly web application that allows users to input relevant data and obtain a personalized prediction of house prices in Bengaluru, 
using Flask web framework and HTML/CSS for the front-end design.
